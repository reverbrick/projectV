We are setting free the work which was done to bring MicroPython and OpenMV to industry.

The project consists:
- OpenMV Camera ethernet hat project and config
- Olimex STM32-E407 brighing camera and Fanuc robot togerther via socket.
- All kind of tests and algorythms.

Sorry for the mess. I'll clean it up and make more comments.
